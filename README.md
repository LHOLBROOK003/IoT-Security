# IoT-Security
The code in this repo was used as part of a Master's thesis at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).  The resulting programs allow the user to apply various machine learning algorithms to identify anomalous network traffic across an IoT network.  The results of the various machine learning algorithms identified anomalies with 99% accuracy.
